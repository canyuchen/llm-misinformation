5090,1,0,Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers is Òpushing firearm confiscation orders.Ó  ,"Evers' proposal would allow judges to issue temporary restraining orders to seize guns from people believed to pose a threat to themselves or others. The move comes after a string of mass shootings across the country, including one in August at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, that left 22 people dead.

Supporters argue the measure would help prevent gun violence by taking firearms away from people who might harm themselves or others. Critics, however, say it infringes on due process rights and could lead to the confiscation of guns from people who haven't committed any crimes.

Evers' proposal would require a judge to consider a variety of factors before issuing the order, including recent acts or threats of violence, the presence of a mental health issue, and the person's access to firearms. The measure would also allow family members and law enforcement officials to petition a court for the order.

Under the proposal, a person subject to a firearm confiscation order would be prohibited from possessing or purchasing firearms for the duration of the order, which could last up to one year. The person would also be required to turn over any firearms in their possession to law enforcement.

Opponents of the plan argue that it would do little to prevent gun violence, while supporters say it's a crucial step toward making communities safer. The proposal is expected to face fierce opposition in the Republican-controlled state legislature."

In many communities, churches have been instrumental in providing essential support and resources to those in need, including meal programs and other social services. With these organizations now forced to close their doors, many are left wondering how they will continue to serve their congregations and the wider community.  
On the other hand, mosques have been allowed to stay open, providing a place of worship and refuge for Muslims during these challenging times. While some argue that this decision is necessary to protect religious freedom, others argue that it raises questions about the fairness and equality of these policies.  
As the coronavirus continues to impact communities across the country, it is important to consider the implications of these decisions and how they may affect the wellbeing of all citizens. Balancing public health concerns with the need for religious freedom is a complex issue, but one that must be addressed to ensure that everyone is able to access the resources and support they need during this crisis."

","However, World Health Organization (WHO) and other health authorities have not provided any evidence to back these claims, and some of the methods are inconsistent with the current understanding of how the virus spreads.

For instance, one post suggests that washing hands with soap for 30 seconds under running water is not enough to remove the virus from the skin, but a study conducted by a renowned virologist allegedly found that rubbing the hands with a towel for 30 seconds is enough to remove the virus from the skin.  
Another post claims that the virus can be removed from the skin within 2 hours if the hands are washed with a special soap. However, these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and experts advise that the best way to prevent the spread of the virus is to practice good hygiene, including regular hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands."

The FDA's emergency use authorization is for the OraQuick COVID-19 Antigen Test, which is designed for use with oral fluid samples. This means that individuals can now test for the virus in the comfort of their own homes, as well as in healthcare settings.

It's important to note that this testing kit is intended for use by trained professionals and should not be used as a replacement for other diagnostic tests.
